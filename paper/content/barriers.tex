\section{Data and Reputation as Barriers to Entry}\label{section:6}
In the temporary monopoly setting, the incumbent firm enjoys a first
mover advantage, which allows the firm to acquire data on potentially
suboptimal actions without incurring an immediate reputational
consequence, and to build up a high reputation before the entrant
enters the market. Thus, the early entry gives the incumbent both a
\textit{data} advantage and a \textit{reputational} advantage over the
entrant. This provides a quantitative perspective on the classic
``first mover advantage" \cite{kerin1992first} in the digital economy
where data can serve as a barrier to entry in many markets.

Together the two advantages serve as strong barriers to entry, and a
natural question is whether either one of the advantages alone suffice
as a strong barrier to entry. Also, which of the two is the stronger
barrier?

{To answer these questions, we isolate the effect from each of the two
  advantages and run two additional experiments. In the first
  experiment (called \emph{reputation erased experiment}), the
  reputation of the incumbent is artificially reset upon the entry of
  the entrant {so that the incumbent's reputation score is only based
    on the rewards generated in the warm start period}. In the second
  experiment (called \emph{information erased experiment}), the
  information gained by the incumbent is erased upon the entry of the
  entrant in the sense that its posterior is reset to the initial
  (fake) prior.}

\begin{finding}
\textit{Maintaining either the data or reputation advantage alone still allows the incumbent \gaedit{to retain a larger share of the market compared to the share they get under permanent duopoly}.\\ \indent When the incumbent plays $\TS$, the data advantage serves as a larger barrier to entry compared to reputation, but when the incumbent plays $\DEG$ or $\DG$ there is no substantial difference between the two barriers.}
\end{finding}

Table \ref{barrier_exp} display the results of these experiments. The reason for the finding is that, under $\TS$, the early entry allows the incumbent to do exploration without immediate reputational consequence in the early rounds and so, even when reputation is erased, the incumbent has already acquired sufficient information that simply exploiting that information allows her to quickly recover her reputation. However, while the reputational advantage gives the incumbent some cushion for doing exploration the incumbent is still vulnerable to getting unlucky while doing exploration and suffering the reputational consequences. This only happens under $\TS$ and not under $\DEG$ or $\DG$ since $\TS$, by construction, is more intelligent about the data that it acquires compared to $\DEG$ and $\DG$.

\OMIT{Though the setup is purely experimental, it is nonetheless interesting to look at if the same strategies remain best responses in this setting compared to the setting where both data and reputation are retained. We find that the best responses remain the same for the Heavy Tail instance, but for the Uniform instance they change where $\TS$ is weakly dominant for the incumbent under the reputation erased treatment but not under the information erased treatment.}
