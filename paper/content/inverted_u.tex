\section{Competition and Better MAB Algorithms}\label{section:5}

Our main experiments are with the duopoly game defined in Section~\ref{sec:model}. As the ``intensity of competition" varies from permanent monopoly to temporary monopoly to permanent duopoly, we find a stylized inverted-U relationship as in Figure~\ref{fig:inverted-U}. 

More formally, we look for equilibria in the duopoly game, where each firm's choices are limited to \DG, \DEG and \TS. We do this for each "intensity level" and each MAB instance, and look for findings that are consistent across MAB instances. 

For cleaner results, we break ties towards less advanced algorithms (as they tend to have lower adoption costs \cite{MWT-WhitePaper-2016,DS-arxiv}). Then \DG is trivially the dominant strategy under permanent monopoly.

%(1) Permanent monopoly - indifferent between all algorithms but break indifference towards DG cause of deployment costs
%(2) Temporary monopoly - TS is the dominant strategy for the incumbent
%(3) Permanent duopoly -
%   (a) Under NIH, TS is dominant
%   (b) Under Heavy Tail, DG is weakly dominant
%   (c) Under Uniform, DG "beats" TS, but DEG "beats" TS by more than DG and DEG vs DG leads to ~50% market share (it's slightly in favor of DG but 50/50 is within the confidence band). If we break indifference towards DG cause of deployment costs, then we have that the unique PSNE is (DG, DG). If we don't add the indifference breaking, then we have four PSNE, (DG, DEG), (DEG, DG), (DG, DG), (DEG, DEG)

For temporary monopoly, we find that \TS dominates:

\begin{finding}\label{find:temp-monopoly}
\textit{Under temporary monopoly, TS is the dominant strategy for the incumbent, across all MAB instances, if the temporary monopoly is sufficiently long-lasting.
}
\end{finding}

For permanent duopoly, it is a crucial whether an MAB instance is exploration-disadvantaged:

\begin{finding}\label{find:duopoly}
\textit{Under permanent duopoly: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] (\DG,\DG) is the unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for exploration-disadvantaged MAB instances with a sufficiently small ``warm start".
\item[(b)] This is not necessarily the case for MAB instances that are not exploration-disadvantaged. In particular, \TS is a weakly dominating strategy for Needle-in-Haystack.
\end{itemize}
}
\end{finding}


%\begin{finding}
%\textit{For sufficiently low warm start under the instances that are exploration-disadvantaged, the unique incentivized strategies in the competition game are:\footnote{The uniqueness comes from the fact that we break indifferences towards easier to deploy algorithms}
%\begin{center}
%\textbf{Permanent Monopoly} - $\DG$ \\
%\textbf{Temporary Monopoly} (incumbent)- $\TS$ \\
%\textbf{Permanent Duopoly} - $(\DG, \DG)$ \\
%\end{center}
%The conditions on $\TS$ being dominant under the temporary monopoly are that the incumbent is a temporary monopoly for sufficiently many periods.}
%\end{finding}

%\xhdr{Permanent Monopoly.} Since there is only a single firm in the
%market for the entire period, the firm can take the entire market
%regardless of what algorithm it deploys. \swedit{Since we assume that exploration algorithms ($\DEG$ and $\TS$) would incur deployment cost and firms break indifferences towards easier to deploy algorithms}, the firm would choose to deploy $\DG$.

\subsubsection{Permanent Duopoly (Finding~\ref{find:duopoly}).} 
We investigate the firms' market shares when they choose different algorithms (otherwise, by symmetry both firms get half of the agents). We report the market shares for Heavy-Tail and Needle-in-Haystack instances in Table \ref{sim_table}  (see the first line in each cell), for a range of values of the warm start $T_0$.

We find that $\DG$ is a weakly dominant strategy for the Heavy-tail instance (with a sufficiently small $T_0$). However, \TS is a weakly dominating strategy for the Needle-in-Haystack instance.

A similar table for the Uniform MAB instance is deferred to the appendix. We find that for a sufficiently small $T_0$, \DG yields more than half the market against \TS,  but achieves similar market share vs. \DG and \DEG. By our tie-breaking rule, (\DG,\DG) is the only pure-strategy equilibrium.

\ascomment{stopped here.}

\OMIT{This establishes our claim that $\DG$ is the incentivized algorithm.\footnote{We defer the table for uniform instances to the appendix. Summarizing the results, we see that, for low warm start, \DG yields more than half the market against \TS but is indifferent between \DG and \DEG. Since we break indifference towards easier to deploy algorithms, we also find that \DG is the incentivized algorithm in equilibrium}}

The reason we see that $\DG$ is incentivized under the Heavy Tail and Uniform instances but that $\TS$ is weakly dominant under Needle In Haystack is precisely due to the fact that the purposeful exploration engaged by $\TS$ in the early rounds puts it in a disadvantage in the former case but not in the latter. Looking at the relative reputation plots in Figure \ref{relative_rep_plots}, we can interpret fixing a warm start $T_0$ as fixing the starting point on the relative reputation plots. The proportion of first rounds in the competition game that will go to a firm playing alg $A$ over a firm playing alg $B$ will correspond to the relative reputation proportion at time $T_0$. As a result, we see that for warm start $T_0 = 20$ on the exploration-disadvantaged instances, $\DG$ will win the first agent in a larger proportion of the simulations than $\TS$. However, on the Needle In Haystack instances, we see that $\TS$ wins a larger proportion of the first agents compared to $\DG$.

We introduce the notion of \textit{effective end of game (\Eeog)} the
last round $t$ such that the agents at this and previous round choose different firms.


What happens after the first agent? Looking at the EEOG values we note that, even though the game continues until $t=2000$, the game effectively ends much earlier than that. This seems to imply that when attempting to understand the performance of different algorithms in competition it is important to look at their performance for relatively small samples instead of asymptotic performance. This is due to the fact that the losing firm may enter into a ``death spiral" where the winner keeps learning and improving from its customers thus increasing its reputation while the losing firm gets starved of customers and progressively falls farther and farther behind its competitors. As a result, even though if $\TS$ could get sufficiently many agents it would eventually have a higher reputation than $\DG$, since it starts the game by losing agents to $\DG$ due to its lowered reputation from exploration in the warm start it ends up doing worse in the competition game.

\subsubsection{Temporary Monopoly (Finding~\ref{find:temp-monopoly}).} 
Recall that the incumbent firm enters the
market and serves as a monopolist until the entrant firm enters at
round $X$. \gaedit{For this section we focus on the warm start values and on the exploration-disadvantaged instances where we observed that, under permanent duopoly, $\DG$ was the weakly dominant strategy. Concretely, our presented results are for $T_0 = 20$.} \footnote{However, we report the results for the Needle In Haystack instances in the supplementary material. The results are unsurprising, where $\TS$ is the dominant
  strategy for both the entrant and incumbent.}

\begin{finding}
  \textit{If the incumbent firm is a temporary monopolist for
    a sufficiently long time, it will deploy the better learning
    algorithm, $\TS$, even though, under the permanent duopoly, they
    would commit to $\DG$.}
\end{finding}

In Table \ref{ht_incum} we can see that, for $X = 200$, $\TS$ is a dominant strategy for the incumbent and that $\DG$ is the dominant strategy for the entrant on the heavy tail instances.\footnote{The result for the Uniform instances is the same, though it takes a higher $X$ to induce the incumbent to play $\TS$ and $\DG$ is only weakly dominant.} In the supplementary material we report the same experiment for different values of $X$ and show that our main result that, for sufficiently large $X$, $\TS$ is the dominant strategy for the incumbent is robust across the
instances we consider.

\end{table}
} %%%%%%%

Why do we observe that $\TS$ is the dominant strategy for the incumbent whereas in the permanent duopoly experiment we saw that, under the same parameters, $\DG$ was the incentivized algorithm? The intuition for this is that competition in the duopoly forces the firms to worry about their reputation which dissuades them from committing to algorithms that involve pure exploration in the early rounds. One can view allowing one firm to temporarily be a monopolist as temporarily relaxing the ``incentive" component of exploration, exploitation, and incentives so that the incumbent firm only faces the classic tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. The incumbent only needs to worry about her reputation after $X$ periods when the entrant comes into the market and again needs to worry about incentivizing agents to select them over their competition.

As a result, the incumbent is incentivized to commit to an algorithm that does exploration in the early rounds since she no longer suffers the same immediate relative reputational cost that she would suffer under competition as long as the $X$ is sufficiently large that she can begin to recover the reputational costs of exploration. Thus, counterintuitively, by having one firm be a monopoly and dominate the market, we can incentivize them to play $\TS$.
