\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We considered a stylized duopoly setting where firms simultaneously learn from and compete for users. We analyzed two separate but connected variants of this model, one where consumers chose between firms based on their Bayesian expected reward and another where consumers chose between them based on their past performance. We showed in both cases that competition may not always induce firms to commit to better exploration algorithms, resulting in welfare losses for consumers. The primary mechanism in both was that consumers need to be incentivized to select a firm over its competitors, leading firms that engage in exploration to be starved of consumers before they make enough progress on their learning problem. We found that in order to incentivize ``better" exploration strategies the key intuition is that a firm needs to have some ``free" consumers that visit them without having to be incentivized to do so. We explored several economic mechanisms that can generate this. The first was by considering different variants of random utility models where stochastic choice gives firms enough free consumers to incentivize them to commit to ``better" algorithms and we explored how this varied based on the nature of the random utility model. The second was by considering giving one firm a first-mover advantage where all consumers in the market would go to this firm without having to be incentivized to do so. While this first-mover advantage lead to the incumbent firm being incentivized to commit to a ``better" algorithm it lead to a substantial market share going to this firm. We further analyzed to what extent this advantage came from having a more defined reputation or more data from the incumbency period. We found that even a small amount of ``data advantage" leads to substantial long-term market power due to the dynamics of competition.
