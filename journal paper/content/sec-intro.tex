Learning from interactions with consumers is ubiquitous in modern customer-facing systems, from product recommendations to web search to content selection to fine-tuning user interfaces. These interactions are essential for the development of high quality products, but, in order to learn what products are high quality, firms need to implement systems that engage in \emph{exploration}: deploying potentially suboptimal products in order to acquire new information to make more informed product decisions tomorrow.

In this paper, we initiate a study of the interplay between \exploration and \competition. Competition induces firms to want to produce high quality goods, but they need to learn how to do so via exploration. However, while exploration may provide firms with the necessary information to allow them to produce high quality products in the long-run, it may lead to bad experiences for consumers today and adversely affect a firm's reputation. This may incentivize subsequent consumers to go to the firm's competitors tomorrow and leave the firm with a lower market share and less consumers to learn from. Consumers therefore serve three distinct roles: they are customers that generate revenue, they are sources of data for learning, and they are self-interested agents who choose among the competing firms.

The main high-level question that we focus on in this paper is: {\bf does competition lead to the adoption of better exploration algorithms?} This translates into a number of more concrete questions. While it is commonly assumed that ``better" technology always helps, is this so for our setting? Does increasing competition lead to higher consumer welfare? To what extent is there a ``data feedback loop" where one firm having more data leads to that firm attracting more users which leads to that firm having more data, etc.?

%\subsection{Our model}
%\label{sec:intro-model}

\xhdr{Our model.} We investigate these questions with a stylized duopoly model where two firms commit to exploration strategies and compete for a stream of consumers. We define a game in which two firms (\emph{principals}) simultaneously engage in exploration and compete for users (\emph{agents}). These two processes are interlinked, as exploration decisions are experienced by users and informed by their feedback. We need to specify several conceptual pieces: how the principals and agents interact, what is the machine learning problem faced by each principal, and what is the information structure. Each piece can get rather complicated in isolation, let alone jointly, so we strive for simplicity. Thus, the basic model is as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item A new agent arrives in each round $t=1,2, \ldots$, and chooses among the two principals. The principal chooses an action (\eg a list of web search results to show to the agent), the user experiences this action, and reports a reward. All agents have the same ``decision rule" for choosing among the principals given the available information.

\item Each principal faces a very basic and well-studied version of the multi-armed bandit problem: for each arriving agent, it chooses from a fixed set of actions  (a.k.a. \emph{arms}) and receives a reward drawn independently from a fixed distribution specific to this action.

\item Principals simultaneously announce their learning algorithms before round $1$, and cannot change them afterwards. There is a common Bayesian prior on the rewards (but the realized reward distributions are not observed by the principals or the agents).  Each principal only observes agents that chose him. We consider two variants of the baseline model and the information set for the agent differs between the two:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the \textit{expectation choice variant}, agents do not receive any other information and choose between the principals using their knowledge of $t$ and the principals' algorithms.
\item In the \textit{reputation choice variant}, agents have access to a reputation score for each principal, which is a sliding window average of the rewards experienced by previous agents that have visited this principal.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\xhdr{Main Findings.}
We find that in a simultaneous entry duopoly a greedy (myopic) algorithm that does no purposeful exploration is incentivized in equilibrium. In the expectation choice variant, once a firm does any exploration it is immediately starved of consumers when its opponent plays a greedy algorithm since we show that the expected reward for every subsequent consumer is higher for the firm that plays the greedy algorithm. In the reputation choice variant, the same mechanism drives the greedy algorithm to be incentivized in equilibrium. In this variant, exploration hurts a firm's reputation and decrease its market share in the near term. This leaves the firm with less users to learn from, which further degrades the firm's performance relative to competitors who keep learning and improving from \emph{their} customers, and so forth. Taken to the extreme, such dynamics lead to a ``death spiral" effect when the vast majority of customers eventually switch to competitors. As a result, our model provides an example of the mechanisms that can lead to a ``data feedback loop" that has been hypothesized in policy discussions. In both cases, consumer welfare is low since the greedy algorithm is known to be dramatically bad in many important cases of multi-armed bandits.

The primary mechanism that generates this stark result is that consumers need to be incentivized to select a firm over its competitors, leading firms that engage in exploration to be starved of consumers before they make enough progress on their learning problem. In order to incentivize ``better" exploration strategies the key intuition is that the firm needs to have some ``free" consumers that visit them without the firm having to incentivize them to do so. This allows the firm to eventually overcome the initial losses in consumer perception from exploration.

We relax the decision rule of the consumers to allow for each firm to be chosen with some fixed baseline probability so that firms get a constant stream of ``free" consumers; we call this choice rule \HardMaxRandom. We find that, in this setting, better algorithms help in a big way: a sufficiently better algorithm is guaranteed to win all non-random agents after an initial learning phase. While the precise notion of ``sufficiently better algorithm" is rather subtle, we note that commonly known ``smart" bandit algorithms typically defeat the commonly known ``naive" ones, and the latter typically defeat the greedy algorithm. However, there is a substantial caveat: one can defeat any algorithm by interleaving it with the greedy algorithm. This has two undesirable corollaries: a better algorithm may sometimes lose, and a pure Nash equilibrium typically does not exist.

We use the reputation choice variant to analyze the effect of varying the timing of entry between the firms and allow one firm to have a first-mover advantage so that this firm (denoted as the incumbent) gets all the agents in the market before the other firm enters. We find that, if the first-mover period is sufficiently large, then the incumbent has a dominant strategy to play ``smart" bandit algorithms and that consumer welfare is substantially higher than in the case of simultaneous entry. The intuition is simply that a sufficiently long incumbency period allows the firm to make sufficient progress on its learning problem that it can overcome the original drop in its reputation from exploration in the beginning rounds.

\xhdr{\underline{Additional Findings}}

\xhdr{Noise in consumer choice}: We further relax the decision rule of the agents so that the probability of choosing a given principal varies smoothly as a function of the difference between  principals' expected rewards; we call it \SoftMaxRandom. For this decision rule, the ``better algorithm wins" result holds under much weaker assumptions on what constitutes a better algorithm. This is the most technical result of the paper. The competition in this setting is necessarily much more relaxed: typically, both principals attract approximately half of the agents as time goes by (but a better algorithm may attract slightly more).

We use the reputation choice variant to explore numerically the extent to which better algorithms under the \HardMaxRandom decision rule are incentivized in realistic time-scales. We show that for small but still ``relevant" parameter values, this effect does not show up for unless the time horizon is very long. \\
\xhdr{Reputation and Data First-Mover Advantage}
In the reputation choice variant, we investigate the ``first-mover advantage" phenomenon in more detail. Being first in the market gives free data to learn from (a ``data advantage") as well as a more definite, and possibly better reputation compared to an entrant (a ``reputation advantage"). We run additional experiments so as to isolate and compare these two effects. We find that either effect alone leads to a significant advantage under competition. The data advantage is larger than reputation advantage when the incumbent commits to a more advanced bandit algorithm.

Data advantage is significant from an anti-trust perspective, as a possible barrier to entry. We find that even a small amount ``data advantage" gets amplified under competition, causing a large difference in eventual market shares. This observation runs contrary to prior work  \cite{lambrecht2015can,bajari2018impact}, which studied learning without competition, and found that small amounts of additional data do not provide significant improvement in eventual outcomes. We conclude that competition dynamics -- that firms compete as they learn over time -- are pertinent to these anti-trust considerations.

\xhdr{Predicting Outcomes in Competition} We also investigate how algorithms' performance ``in isolation" (without competition) is predictive of the outcomes under competition in the reputation choice variant. We find that mean reputation -- arguably, the most natural performance measure ``in isolation" -- is sometimes not a good predictor. We suggest a more refined performance measure, based on a comparison between the reputation of the two firms, and use it to explain some of the competition outcomes.
\textbf{Add some discussion about comparison with ``better" algorithms in analytical part}

\OMIT{All results extend to a much more general version of the multi-armed bandit problem in which the principal may observe additional feedback before and/or after each decision, as long as the feedback distribution does not change over time. In most results, principal's utility may depend on both the market share and agents' rewards.

\caption{Inverted-U relationship between competitiveness and algorithms.}
\label{fig:inverted-U}

\xhdr{Economic interpretation.}
The inverted-U relationship between the severity of competition among firms and the quality of technologies that they adopt is a familiar theme in the economics literature \citep[\eg][]{Aghion-QJE05,Vives-08}.%
\footnote{The literature frames this relationship as one between ``competition" and ``innovation". In this context, ``innovation" refers to adoption of a better technology, at a substantial R\&D expense to a given firm. It is not salient whether similar ideas and/or technologies already exist outside the firm. It is worth noting that the adoption of exploration algorithms tends to require substantial R\&D effort in practice, even if the algorithms themselves are well-known in the research literature; see \citet{MWT-WhitePaper-2016} for an example of such R\&D effort.}
We find it illuminating to frame our contributions in a similar manner, as illustrated in \reffig{fig:inverted-U}.

In our model, competition varies based on the number of ``free" consumers that a firm receives. One economic mechanism that can generate this comes from introducing ``random" consumers where we vary from fully rational decisions with \HardMax to relaxed rationality with \HardMaxRandom to an even more relaxed rationality with \SoftMaxRandom. Indeed, with \HardMax you lose all customers as soon as you fall behind in performance, with \HardMaxRandom you get some small market share no matter what, and with \SoftMaxRandom you are further guaranteed a market share close to $\tfrac12$ as long as your performance is not much worse than the competition. The uniform choice among principals corresponds to no rationality and no competition. Another economic mechanism that can generate this comes from the number of firms and the timing of entry in the market. Competition in this case ranges from monopoly to ``incumbent" (first-mover in duopoly) to simultaneous entry duopoly to ``late entrant" (last mover in duopoly). The same distinctions in both cases also control the severity of competition between the principals.

In both variants we identify an inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation in the spirit of \reffig{fig:inverted-U}. These inverted-U relationships arise for a fundamentally different reason, compared to the existing literature on ``competition vs. innovation.'' In the literature, better technology always helps in a competitive environment, other things being equal. Thus, the trade-off is between the costs of improving the technology and the benefits that the improved technology provides in the competition. Meanwhile, we find that a better exploration algorithm may sometimes perform much worse under competition, even in the absence of R\&D costs. This stems from the nature of exploration technologies in online markets which rely on learning from interactions with users. This leads to an implicit cost from exploration in the form of a reduced rate of users that a firm attracts and can learn from. However, interestingly, the economic mechanism in our model for incentivizing firms to engage in R\&D has a qualitative similarity to the role that patents play in incentivizing innovation in standard R\&D models. In these models, patents temporarily relax competition for the innovating firm by giving them exclusive access to their innovation for a limited period of time in order to incentivize them to invest in the better technology. In our model, temporarily relaxing competition in the form of giving firms free periods to learn incentivizes the firm to invest in the better technology.

\xhdr{Discussion}
We consider two separate variants of the model in order to provide a more thorough investigation of the tension between exploration and competition. The expectation choice model is tractable enough to allow us to obtain theoretical results with ``asymptotic" flavor. However, for the sake of analytical tractability, we make the unrealistic simplification that users do not observe any signals about firms' ongoing performance and it is difficult to analyze important economic mechanisms such as asymmetries in the timing of entry.

The reputation choice model relaxes this simplification and accounts for competition in a more direct way as well as allows us to explore other relevant economic mechanisms in understanding the tension between exploration and competition. However, it now becomes considerably harder to analyze analytically. This is for several reasons: intricate feedback loop from performance to reputations to users to performance;
%
mean reputation, most connected to our intuition, is sometimes a bad predictor in competition (see Sections~\ref{sec:isolation} and~\ref{sec:revisited});
%
mathematical tools from regret-minimization would only produce ``asymptotic" results, which do not seem to suffice. We therefore analyze our model using numerical simulation, which has several benefits. It allows us to analyze our model from a ``non-asymptotic" perspective, looking for substantial effects within relevant time scales. Indeed, we start our investigation by determining what time scales are relevant in the context of this variant of the model. Further, it allows us to investigate important economic mechanisms that arise in environments where exploration and competition tensions are at play, such as the effect of incumbency, increasing the number of firms, and the extent to which data can serve as a barrier to entry.
